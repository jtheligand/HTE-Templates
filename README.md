# HTE-Templates
 
This repository contains a series of Excel notebooks that are designed to help users manage multidimensional HTE screens and campaigns. They were designed and implemented by Jessica Sampson at the University of Delaware and are under active development. Files should be re-downloaded for each screen as the ligand directory in these files will be updated as the ligand library is updated.

As of 9/14/23 the 24-well versions are not currently up-to-date, but the 96-well versions were updated to allow tracking of reagent source and to generate a version that has well-by-well variation.
