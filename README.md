# HTE-Templates
 
This repository contains a series of Excel notebooks that are designed to help users manage multidimensional HTE screens and campaigns. They were designed and implemented by Jessica Sampson at the University of Delaware and are under active development. Files should be re-downloaded for each screen as the ligand directory in these files will be updated as the ligand library is updated.

As of 10/21/23 the 24-well versions are up-to-date.

Notebooks can be uploaded to the UD HTE ELN by going to: https://forms.gle/8m4Kee8XAc6q15dC6
